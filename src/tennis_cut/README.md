# Tennis Cut CLI

Command-line tool for extracting tennis swing clips from a video. For now it relies solely on audio peak detection and does not crop the video.

Run:

```bash
python tennis_cut.py <input.mp4> [options]
```

The available options match those described in `spec.md` under the *Command-line Interface* section.
